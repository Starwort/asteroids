# Asteroids

HTML5 multi-player Asteroids. A work-in-progress mostly to demonstrate ES6, canvas, and web sockets.

Work in progress. To do:

* slow framerate animation
* gamepad support
* multiplayer
* object serialisation: one player becomes the master and transmits all game data on init? Alternatively, players receive events over time.

power-ups:

* increase/decrease bullet size
* rapid fire (no button release)
