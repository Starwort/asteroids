# Asteroids

HTML5 multi-player Asteroids. A work-in-progress mostly to demonstrate ES6, keyboard/mouse/gamepad/touch control, canvas, sound, web sockets and more!

Work in progress. To do:

* multiplayer
* object serialisation: one player becomes the master and transmits all game data on init/request? Alternatively, players receive events over time?
